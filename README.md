**Description of the project:**
This project uses the World Bank’s Education Statistics dataset to explore long-term trends and relationships among key indicators of the US education system. Our goal is to understand how structural aspects of education (access, staffing, and outcomes) have evolved over time and how changes in one variable may influence changes in another. We will analyze variables in different categories and see differences between sexes. By focusing on longitudinal, cross-national data, we aim to identify potential patterns and meaningful interactions that could inform educational policy and investment.

The analysis of various indicators will allow us to examine temporal changes and potential external factors that might shape different educational outcomes. We selected three major indicator categories that reflect different dimensions of the education system:
Enrollment rate vs Attendance rate
We will compare enrollment and attendance rates across different levels of schooling (primary, secondary, tertiary) to examine whether higher enrollment leads to consistent attendance over time.
Number of teachers vs Teaching staff compensation
We will investigate how changes in staffing levels correspond with compensation levels across educational stages.
Educational attainment rate
We will track changes in the proportion of the population and see differences between sexes achieving different levels of education to understand broader societal progress and disparities.
Motivation
When we were brainstorming datasets to go with, we had difficulty choosing a topic because the possibilities were endless. We looked at several options from public health to climate to economics, but we eventually narrowed it down to education, which was something that all of us are connected to and that our classmates and readers could easily relate to. We initially considered focusing on Emory-specific data but broadened our scope to the World Bank’s Education Statistics for its larger context and long-term coverage.
As students at an American university, we were especially interested in examining data trends within the United States. Education policy and access here have evolved significantly over time, and exploring long-term patterns in enrollment, attendance, and staffing can reveal whether increased investment in education translates into better participation and equity. This directly relates to us, as college students who have undergone the three main levels of education and were told that our own efforts, most notably in high school, would determine our outcomes later in life. But how much do individual outcomes actually depend on the student, and how much on the school systems and structures that support them?

**Structure:**
We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in R using the tidyverse suite of libraries. Our analysis will include:
Cleaning and reshaping selected indicators
Visualizing trends across time and education levels
Examining relationships among variables through summary statistics and correlation plots
Interpreting observed trends in relation to historical or policy-level changes such as shifts in federal funding
